Question:

Write a Python program to find the position of the second occurrence of a given number in a given list of numbers.
Function will take as input a list of numbers as first argument and a numeric variable as second argument . 
This function should return the index where the given variable value occurs in the list for the second time

Function signature:
getIndex(listOfIntegers,NumericVariable):

In the above function signature, First argument represents list of integer values and
Second argument represents a number, whose second occurred position(index) to be returned.
The function should return the index of the number(supplied as second argument), occurred for the second time in the list.

If the number does not occur for the second time in the input list or If the number does not exist in the list then the function should return 0.

Develop a main program , with below sequence of actions:

a. Create an empty list .
b. Read the size of the list from standard input
c. Based on the size of the list read above, repeat reading and adding the elements to the list created.
d. Read the number, whose index is to be searched for its second occurrence .
e. Then call getIndex function by supplying the input list as first argument and numeric value ( whose index is to be searched for its second occurrence) as second argument.
Function should return the index of the second occurrence of the number(whose value supplied as second argument to the main program through numeric variable)
Finally print the returned value of the function.

Look at the Sample testcase below for more clarity to write the input and output statements in the main section.

1.Sample Testcase1#:
Let us assume to create a list with 5 elements (3,4,3,7,4) and
to search for the index of the second occurrence of 3 in the list

Input :

5
3
4
3
7
4
3

Output:
2

Desctription:
In the above Input, the first line content(5) represents the number of elements in the list, to be created
From Second line to 6th line represents the 5 elements as below and to be added to the list created.
3
4
3
7
4

The last line content (3) represents the number to search for its second occurance position(Index)
in the input list

Output is 2 means, the element 3 is found second time at the index value 2 , in the given input list.


2.Sample Testcase#2:
Input:
4
2
3
4
5
5
Output:
0

Desctription:
In the above Sample Input, the first line content(4) represents the number of elements in the list, to be created
From Second line to 5th line represents the 4 elements as below and to be added to the list created.
2
3
4
5
The last line content (5) represents the number to search for its second occurance position(Index) in the input list

Output is 0 means, the element 5 is not found second time in the input list .
