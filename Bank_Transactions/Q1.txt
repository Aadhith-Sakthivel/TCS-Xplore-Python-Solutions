Question 1 :

Create a class Account with the below attributes:
int accntNo
String accntName
int accntBalance

Create a constructor which takes all parameters in the above sequence.


Create a class AccountDemo

Create a default constructor in the AccountDemo class as below

def __init__(self):
pass

Create a method depositAmnt which takes an Account object and amount to be deposited (amount) as input parameters. 
Update the balance i.e. Add the amount to the existing balance and return the updated balance

Create another method withdrawAmnt which takes an Account object and amount to be deposited (amount) as input parameters.
Deduct the amount from the balance and return the updated balance. Minimum balance to be maintained is 1000.
i.e if the balance is becoming less than 1000 when deducting the withdrawal amount, the operation need to be stopped with a message "No Adequate balance"


To test the code against your customized Input through console, the input data needs to be entered in the below order( as shown below in the sample input).

The first three lines in the below sample input represents the input for three variables of account object 
i.e account no. (accntNo),account name (accntName) and account balance (accntBalance), with which the object will be created.

The fourth line in the sample input is the input for the amount to be deposited in the account object and fifth line is 
the input for the amount to be withdrawn from the account object

Sample input:-
120
Rajesh
1500
1200
2000


Sample output for the above input:-
2700
No Adequate balance

Note:
For more details on
a. Input data entered from standard input
b. How this data is processed
c. The order of the input data

please refer the below main program.

Note:
Please request you to use the below main program to test/run your code and submit this main along with your solution.
Dont write separate main function again on your own.

if __name__ == '__main__':
acno=int(input())
acname=raw_input()
acntbal=int(input())
depamnt=int(input())
withamnt=int(input())
acnt=Account(acno,acname,acntbal)
acntdemoobj=AccountDemo()
print(acntdemoobj.depositAmnt(acnt,depamnt))
print(acntdemoobj.withdrawAmnt(acnt,withamnt))
